# Integration Testing: Mocks and Stubs

The following hierarchy of components represents a structure of dependencies between components.

<br>

Some of the previous components are simple and can be implemented with low effort. Hence, it's better to code and integrate them, instead of using stubs (described in the presentation). Which components require stubs?

The rule of thumb is to use stubs for

- not implemented components that can be replaced by doubles which can provide canned answers equivalent to those offered by the real component;

- external subsystems out of the programmer's control.

Let's suppose that the Repository and the EmailGateway are the most complex components from the hierarchy. Shall we create stubs for each of them to test the CustomerController or wait until their implementations are available?
## EmailGateway

The EmailGateway provides an interface with low complexity, but its implementation may be complicated.
```
public interface IEmailGateway {
    public void sendSpecialGreetings(Customer customer);
    public void sendRegularGreetings(Customer customer);
}
```
We only have one test condition to validate

- Are emails been sent according to the city of the customer?

Finally, gateway email components depend on external infrastructure  (e.g., SMTP server) that's out of programmer's control, which may not be available or configured for testing purposes. 

The previous arguments combined, make the gateway an excellent candidate for a stub.

## Repository

Similarly to the EmailGateway component, the Repository has a low complex interface.

```
public interface ICustomerRepository {
    public Customer getCustomerByEmail(String s);
    public void save(Customer customer);
}
```

However, one stub for the Repository component should hold canned answers that makes the implementation effort of the stub higher, namely

- Is the save method verifying for existing emails when saving new customers? 

- Is the customer saved in the database after invoking the save method?

Finally, since the com.es2.repository is under the programmer's control, he/she may decide that the real component contribution is higher than the stub counterpart for testing purposes.

The next step is to integrate the com.es2.repository with the real CustomerController.


## Mocks or Stubs

The EmailGateway interface has two methods. Each method sends a specific greeting email. How to test whether the correct greeting message has been sent to the customer?

A mock object is used to testify the method invocation, but without checking the EmailGateway's state, it's impossible to determine the greeting message sent. In this scenario, we need a stub instead of a mock object.

## Exercise 1

Import the components' implementation into a new project.

Implement the EmailGatewayStub. You can generate the methods' skeleton from the interface automatically, using the options of the IntelliJ's Code menu.

Create a new Test Case (named EmailGWIntegration) and add a new test that:

-creates a new customer

-asserts each of the customer's fields stored in the com.es2.repository

-sends a greeting message to the customer

-asserts the number of emails sent by the gateway

The EmailGatewayStub should implement the following method to validate the last assertion.

```
public static int getSentEmails(){
    return this.sentEmails;
}
```

The created stub doesn't look like a stub. Why?

## Exercise 2

That's true!!! Our stub is actually a mock object.

It's not possible to test important objects' state using mock objects. As an example, we didn't evaluate the correctness of the message sent to the customer. A fault in the implementation of the EmailGateway may lead this component to switch greeting messages. We need a stub to validate such a condition.

How to create a stub that asserts the greeting message sent to the customer?

We need to evaluate the object's state to obtain the list of sent messages.

```
public static ArrayList<String> getMessagesSent() {
    return messagesSent;
}
```

We also have to change the test case to evaluate the correctness of the message sent to the customer.

Now, you can submit the JAR file for testing.

## Exercise 3

One last challenge. The test case implementation is brittle, as it depends on the update of the list of messages sent every time one of the send* methods is invoked. 
```
@Override
public void sendRegularGreetings(Customer customer) {
    //...
    messagesSent.add("Hello Dear Customer" + customer.getName());
}
```
Tests can be broken if the programmer adds new greeting formats without updating the list of messages sent. On top of that, we have code duplication. How to solve this design issue?
